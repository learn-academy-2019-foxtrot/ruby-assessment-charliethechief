# ASSESSMENT 4: INTRO TO RUBY
## Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions. First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory. Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own there is always something more to learn.   

1. In what ways are JavaScript and Ruby similar? In what ways are they different?

  Your answer: They are both object oriented languages. Ruby's syntax is very different than Javascript's. Ruby has less symbols and more words making it easier for humans to read.

  Researched answer: JavaScript and Ruby are object-oriented and general scripting language which is interpreted rather than compiled. JavaScript can be used as front-end and back-end language using the same language where as Ruby is used as back-end programming language. JavaScript can be faster than Ruby.



2. What is a hash?

  Your answer:A data structure that can store things.

  Researched answer: A hash is a data structure that stores items by associated keys. Hashes allow you to have many key value pairs.



3. What is the testing framework used in Ruby? Describe the process of setting up the testing environment.

  Your answer: RSpec. Use gems to install rspec
  ex: 'gem install rspec'. Once installed test your code in the terminal with: ruby "file name".rb

  Researched answer: RSpec is a testing tool for Ruby, created for behavior-driven development (BDD). It is the most frequently used testing library for Ruby in production applications. Even though it has a very rich and powerful DSL (domain-specific language), at its core it is a simple tool which you can start using rather quickly. Test Driven Development involves writing a test that fails, and then writing code to make it pass, followed by refactoring. Because failing test output is colored red in your terminal, and passing test output is colored green, the TDD process is frequently described as Red-Green-Refactor.



4. Name three possible relationships between objects?

  Your answer: Association, inheritance, and aggregation.

  Researched answer: Inheritance , association, composition and aggregation. All these relationship is based on "is a" relationship, "has-a" relationship and "part-of" relationship.



5. What is an instance variable? How is it different from other variables in Ruby?

  Your answer: They are used to share data. A class instance variable only belongs to one class while others can be shared to multiple  

  Researched answer: In Rails, instance variables are used to share data between your controller & views. Class variables are shared between a class and all its subclasses, while class instance variables only belong to one specific class.



6. Ruby has a great community and tons of free resources to help you learn. [Here](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/)is a list of great resources. Below are a few popular ones:
- [Interactive Ruby Tutorial](http://tryruby.org/levels/1/challenges/0)
- [Why's (poigniant) Guide to Ruby](http://poignant.guide/book/chapter-1.html): comics, anecdotes, and microscopic canaries
- [Ruby in 20 Min](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/quickstart/)
- [Ruby Style Guide](https://rubystyle.guide/)

Choose one of these resources and look through the material for 10-15 min. List three new things you learned about Ruby:

1) Duck typing: When a method accepts a variable but not really.

2) Ruby is dynamically typed and uses garbage collection.

3) It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.
